# @akatori-design/rain-on-glass

Rain running down a fogged window, as a drop-in `<rain-on-glass>` web component. Drops land,
merge, drip and refract the view behind the glass, streams run in heavy rain, and viewers can
wipe the glass with three fingers. Built with WebGL 2. It works in plain HTML, React, Vue,
Svelte, Framer, Webflow and anywhere else that renders HTML.

## Install

This package lives on GitHub Packages and is private. You need to have been given access, and
a GitHub personal access token (classic) with the `read:packages` scope.

1. Add an `.npmrc` next to your project's `package.json`:

   ```
   @akatori-design:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
   //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
   ```

2. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your shell or CI to your token. Never commit the token itself.

3. Install:

   ```bash
   npm install @akatori-design/rain-on-glass
   ```

## Use

```js
import '@akatori-design/rain-on-glass';
```

```html
<rain-on-glass controls></rain-on-glass>
<rain-on-glass rainfall="30%" scene="night" style="height: 100vh"></rain-on-glass>
```

The element fills its container's width at a 16:10 ratio. Give it a `height` or `aspect-ratio`
in CSS to change that.

inside the element (visible in browser DevTools), the `credits` property, and a credit line in
the control tray. The licence does not allow removing any of them.
